# Speaker_diri_workouts

For the introduction to speech processing using machine learning, we took a completed project mainly from "https://github.com/muskang48/Speaker-Diarization"  to understand the different aspects and performance parameters concerning the analysis.
 This is done in the ipynb files named 1.ipynb, 4.ipynb and 2.ipynb executed exactly in the aforesaid order.
 A secondary program (another_phase1.ipynb) was also executed which used diarisation() function from the torch module to find the diarised output.
 
 A segmenting program was also analysed named raw_segmentation.ipynb to understand the principles of segmentation.
